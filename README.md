To run without electron, start a python server in the sim-engine folder (`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)

Open `http://localhost:8000?game=GAME_FOLDER_NAME`

To setup electron:

`npm install`

To run:

`npm start`

To change what game runs in electron, modify CURRGAME to contain only the name of the folder
